### What is Typeflow? ###

** TypeFlow is a multifunctional superlanguage with an innovative syntax. The idea behind TypeFlow is that it has the feature set of a modern OOP languange, 
but it features a very complete standard library. The innovative syntax, or what we like to call "Free Syntax." It is special because it allows many 
freedoms in the syntax, it has many ways to be written and interepreted, as well as configurations depending on what the developer wants.**

**TypeFlow also features a bytecode VM, which makes sure that any system can run it.**
